While this provides a foundational benchmark, the classification report reveals that a linear approach struggle to capture the complex, non-linear relationships inherent in bimodal biosignals. Specifically, the precision for the depressed class (1) was 0.62, highlighting a significant margin for error when relying solely on basic spectral and acoustic averages.\n",
